/*
     * The drive() method in the Car class does not override the version in the Automobile class since the method is not visible to the Car class.
    The drive() method in the ElectricCar class is a valid override of the method in the Car class, with the access modifier expanding in the subclass.
    = For these reasons, the code compiles, and Option D is incorrect.
    In the main() method, the object created is an ElectricCar, even if it is assigned to a Car reference. Due to polymorphism, the method from the ElectricCar will be invoked, making Option B the correct answer.
